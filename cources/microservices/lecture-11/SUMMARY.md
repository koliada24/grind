## Lecture 11. Benefits of Microservices Architecture

Here are several main benefits of using microservices architecture:
- Agility, innovation and time-to-market. Microservices enable faster development and independent deployment of features, allowing applications to reach production more quickly.
- Flexible scalability. Because microservices are independent each service can be scaled separately without scaling the entire application.
- Small, focused teams. It is more efficient for several small teams to own and manage individual services than for one large team to work on the entire application.
- Small and separate codebases. Microservices do not share codebases which minimizes dependencies and makes it easier to add new features and assess the impact of changes.
