Lecture 8. Threads synchronization overview

In this lecture the problem of shared resources in async programming
was covered. To present the problem in-practice, the demo app with
two counters and two threads on which the increment method was running
were created.

The idea is that there is 3 steps of working with recources:
1. Getting recource value;
2. Taking some actions;
3. Setting updated resoirce value;

The problem is if there are, for example, two threads working with
the same resource, there is a possibility that threads won't
take into account the changes other threads did because they haven't wait for
the end of operation on the other threads and had been working with
outdated data which leads to lost operations.
