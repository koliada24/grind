## Description

This is the repo I've created to store the notes of the cources and track my coding activity

## Flow of the studing by lectures

- Watch lecture
- While watching, write all the programs with the lector in case he is writing one
- After the lecture ends, instantly create a small summary to consolidate knowledge and to make it easier to refresh what was the topic of the lecture in future. NOTE: ask AI to understand everything, do not be lazy 😉
